## Overview
### Description
A tool to help students find tutors and tutors to connect with students.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Connects tutors and students to each other based on preferences and filters. 
- **Market:** Upper-level education students and their respective tutors.
- **Habit:** The app would be used based on need and how often the user wants to be tutored/tutor. 
- **Scope:** First the app would present the search filters and the user can choose depending on which subject or area they want to work with. The user can then view different information about the person they choose in their details/about page and decide whether or not to contact them.
